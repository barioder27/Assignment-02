Classical simulation of quantum systems

Description

For many information theoretic tasks, an advantage can be gained if quantum systems are used as the basic carrier of information, rather than classical variables. For example, it may be the case that with quantum systems, fewer resources are required. The project will investigate the classical simulation of quantum systems in simple scenarios in which quantum systems are communicated from one party to another, or in which quantum systems are measured to produce correlated outcomes. The aim is to compare the resources required by the classical simulation with those required when quantum systems are used.

Prerequistes

Linear algebra. A student taking this project should also be taking the Quantum Computer Science course. Some extra reading to cover the basic formalism of quantum theory would be an advantage.
